# Wiki Degrees

WikiÂ° is a site written in python/Flask to try and find how many clicks it would take you to get from one Wikipedia page to another only clicking the first link in the body. I hope to show how connected Wikipedia is.

## FAQ

#### Why is my query not in the recent queries

If a query results in a deadend or goes longer than 1000 links it will not save to the database so it can try again the next time it is queried.

#### Why did it skip a link

A link will be skipped if it redirects to another Wiki or if it is a link to one of Wikipedia's own urls.
